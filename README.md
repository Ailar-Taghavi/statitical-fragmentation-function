# statitical-fragmentation-function
Simulation and modeling of the QCD statistical evolution of un-integrated Parton Distribution Function and un-integrated Fragmentation Function to make a supervised regression model. Validate the results by fitting to the classified TASSO, AMY, MARK II, CELLO, DELPHI, SLD and ALEPH data sets in order to predict the future data.
